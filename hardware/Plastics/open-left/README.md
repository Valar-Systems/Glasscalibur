# Print Guide

There are two folders to choose from. The STL folder contains the STLs for each individual part

The platter folder contains two platters which have all parts laid in the correct orientations.

**Printing the platters is recommended**

### Print Settings:
* Use PETG only
* 0.25 mm layer height
* In PrusaSlicer go to "Print Settings" -> "Seam position" -> set to "Rear"
