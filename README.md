## How to built it

This build includes a large number of different screws, nuts, and hardware that are difficult to find. In order to bring the cost of building this to the lowest possible level, we have created a kit, as well as a list of additional required hardware from Amazon. By purhasing the large and heavy products from Amazon, we are able to decrease the total cost of the entire build to an affordable level.

To decrease the price even more, please 3D print the parts in the "hardware" folder. If you do not have a 3D printer, you may purchase a kit with 3D printed parts.

Here is everything you will need to purchase:
